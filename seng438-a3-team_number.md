# 1 Introduction

In this laboratory session, we delved into the fundamental concepts and application of white-box testing. Our exploration entailed the utilization and expansion of our pre-existing test suite, alongside the incorporation of novel coverage metrics such as statement and branch coverage. We crafted fresh white-box test cases aimed at augmenting code coverage and assessed the enhancements vis-à-vis our initial implementation. Moreover, a scrutiny of specific methods' data-flow coverage was conducted.

Through the utilization of white-box testing methodologies integrated with coverage tools, we accomplish the following objectives: Ensuring thorough testing of all code pathways including branches, loops, and exception handling. Identifying areas within the codebase that lack sufficient testing, thus enabling targeted improvements to the test suite. Improving the overall design and maintainability of the codebase. Detecting and rectifying errors at an early stage in the development lifecycle.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Our strategy involves reviewing the code implemented in our prior tests for Assignment 2, with the aim of identifying any gaps in our plans and test coverage. Through this process, we aim to gain insights into the metrics guiding our work and enhance the quality of these files by introducing additional tests. By regularly assessing our metrics and existing test coverage, we can pinpoint areas requiring new tests, taking into account both what has already been tested and what is currently under development. Our tool of choice for this endeavor is EmlEmma, which seamlessly integrates with Eclipse, our primary development platform.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Pros of using EclEmma for test coverage:

-Integration with Eclipse IDE: EclEmma seamlessly integrates with Eclipse, making it easy to set up and use within the development environment.

-Multiple coverage metrics: EclEmma offers a variety of coverage metrics, including statement (line), branch, and method coverage, providing comprehensive insights into test coverage.

-Additional coverage measurements: Apart from the metrics chosen, EclEmma offers additional coverage measurement options, allowing for a more thorough analysis of code coverage.

-Color-highlight feedback: The tool provides color-highlight feedback on code, facilitating the identification of lines with errors or lacking coverage.

-Improvement guidance: EclEmma highlights covered lines of code for statement coverage, aiding in the improvement of test code to achieve better coverage.

Cons of using EclEmma for test coverage:

-Dark highlight colors: The highlight colors provided by EclEmma might be too dark, which can make it difficult to read the code, potentially causing strain on the eyes.

-Lack of condition coverage: EclEmma does not offer condition coverage, necessitating a switch to method coverage, which might not provide as detailed insights into code coverage.

-Limited information for branch coverage: EclEmma does not provide sufficient information to specify the number of states for branch coverage, making it challenging to improve branch coverage and debug effectively.
